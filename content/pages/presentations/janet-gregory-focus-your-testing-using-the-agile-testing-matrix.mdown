The next Agile Edmonton user group meeting will be on **Wednesday, February 4th at noon**.

#### Presentation Overview

The agile testing matrix provides a common vocabulary to agile teams for customers, testers and developers.  It is a powerful tool which focuses on the purpose of different types of testing necessary for any agile project.  There are tests that support the team and drive development, and tests which critique the product.  Janet will talk about the different roles on a team and how they can work together to get all your testing done.
